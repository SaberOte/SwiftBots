ERRORS
======
- Add logs everywhere in views
- Message from admin sending functions doesn't log if raised.
- Bots with not overloaded loggers won't use app's logger

ROADMAP
=======
- Load in the app settings before it starts. Settings like the map of tasks/views/bots to run.
- Remove sqlalchemy and alembic from project. They're useless here.
- Implement new app design like in file examples/new_ui.py
- Add picture handling for TelegramBot
- use normal logger
- Remake ways to start/stop bots. Using base exception breaks a grpc server

NEW FEATURES
============
- Add admin with report method as a dependency

REFACTORING
===========
- Write docs
- Use license
